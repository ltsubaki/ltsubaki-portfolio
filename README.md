This repository showcases a collection of projects developed during my school year, highlighting my skills and growth as a developer. Each project demonstrates my ability to apply theoretical knowledge to practical problems, utilize various programming languages and tools, and follow best practices in software development.

You win when you get four in a row, all four corners, or all four center squares. A close friend of mine is Mexican, and his family enjoys playing Lotería when they get together. His mom expressed discontent with the current app that she has, so I thought I could design a cleaner and more user friendly version! Stay tuned for this app completion!
